	 		Differences between "abstract class" and "interface"
	 
	 1)  Abstract class = You can use "abstract" and "concrete" methods
	 	 Interface      = You can use just "abstract " methods
	 					  After JAVA 8, WE ARE able to use "concrete" methods
	 					  by using "default(default methods) " or "static" keywords.
	  
	 2)  Abstract class = You can extend to abstract clasess, you can implement interfaces
	   	Interface       = You can extends to interface, you can not extends/implement to class
	 
	 3) Abstract class = An abstract class cannot have multiple parent class, but it can have 
	 					 multiple parent interface
	 	Interface      = An interface can have multiple parent interfaces, but cannot have any 
	 					parent class
	 4) Abstract class = You can use any type of variables				
	 	Interface      = All variables are public, final and static
	 	
	 5) Abstract class = When you create a method, you have to "abstract" keyword
	 	Interface      = When you create a method, no need to use "abstract" keyword
	 					 All methods in an interface are "public"  and "abstract" as default.
	 					 
	 					 
	 			 !!! YOU CANNOT CREATE OBJECT BY USING ABSTRACT CLASSES AND INTERFACES

	 				What is the OOP concept in Java? (object oriented program)
	 				OOP Concept has 4 main features.
	 1) Abstraction ==> Abstract class and Interface
	 2) Encapsulation ==> Data Hiding, using private access modifier, getter and setter methods
	 3) Inheritance ===> parent-child relationship
	 4) Polymorphise ==> Overloading + Overriding
